## Ideas

Things I'd love to see built that would enhance the crypto ecosystem. If you're working on any of these let me know at my name @blueyard.com, we could have funding for you. 

### Onchain Regen Score

Many public good projects would love to airdrop their tokens to users who have given to public goods previously, however there is no list/database of all public good contracts that could be included. Some examples woudl be:

- Giving to any Gitcoin projects
- Giving to any Giveth projects
- Donations to Ukraine
- Donations to Protocol Guild

Less public goods but still donations:

- Buying NFT to support Ethereum Movie
- Buying SongADayMan's NFT's. 
- Buying Bold Leondas NFT's
